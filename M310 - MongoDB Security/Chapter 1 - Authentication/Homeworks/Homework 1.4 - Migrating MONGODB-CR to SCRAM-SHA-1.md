# Homework 1.4: Migrating MONGODB-CR to SCRAM-SHA-1

**Problem:**

For this lab you are going to migrate a database from using the MONGODB-CR authentication mechanism to SCRAM-SHA-1.

We've provided you with a script that will set up and start a mongod against some MongoDB 2.6 data files that include user data. A user was created on these 2.6 data files, alice, her password is secret. You'll need to copy the files to the shared folder.

```
$ cd ~/shared
$ ./setup-hw-1.4.sh
```

Once your MongoDB Enterprise 3.2 server is up and running with the 2.6 data files it's your job to migrate the server (and Alice's account) over to SCRAM-SHA-1.

After you've successfully completed the migration you can run the following script and copy the last line of output into the submission area below.

```
$ cd ~/shared
$ ./validate-hw-1.4.sh
```
