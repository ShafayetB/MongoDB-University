# Ticket: Handling Errors

**Task**

For this ticket, you'll be required to make the API more robust by handling exceptions. Specifically, what would happen should an incorrectly formatted _id be passed to get_movie in db.py?

To determine the exact exception that will be thrown in this case, please consult the documentation to see which exceptions pymongo and bson can raise:

- pymongo exceptions
- bson exceptions

Once you've determined the exception you need to handle, make sure to catch it in the get_movie method.

Although this ticket will only test that you've handled exceptions for the get_movie method, it's also a good idea to look over the entirety of db.py to look for other potential exceptions and handle them!

You can find examples of Error Handling in notebooks/error_handling.ipynb.
