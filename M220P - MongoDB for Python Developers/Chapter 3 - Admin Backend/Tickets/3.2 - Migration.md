# Ticket: Migration

**Task**

For this ticket, you'll be required to complete the command-line script located in the migrations directory of mflix called movie_last_updated_migration.py.

Things always change, and a requirement has come down that the lastupdated value in each document of the movies collection needs to be stored as an ISODate rather than a String.

Complete the script so it updates the values using the bulk API.

To perform the migration, run the script:

```
python movie_last_updated_migration.py
```

You can find examples of Bulk Operations in notebooks/bulk_writes.ipynb.
