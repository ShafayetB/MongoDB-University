# Lab: Changing Document Shape with $project 

**Problem:**

Our first movie night was a success. Unfortunately, our ISP called to let us know we're close to our bandwidth quota, but we need another movie recommendation!
</br>
Using the same $match stage from the previous lab, add a $project stage to only display the the title and film rating (title and rated fields).
</br>
- Assign the results to a variable called pipeline.
```
var pipeline = [{ $match: {. . .} }, { $project: { . . . } }]
```
