**Task**

For this ticket, you'll be required to modify the following methods:

_MovieDao.java_

**- validIdValue**

_CommentDao.java_

**Testing and Running the Application**

If the application is already running, **stop the application** and run the unit tests for this ticket by executing the following command:
