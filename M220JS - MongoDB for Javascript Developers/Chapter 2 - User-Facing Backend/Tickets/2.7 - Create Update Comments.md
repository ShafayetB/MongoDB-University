# Ticket: Create/Update Comments

**User Story**

"As a user, I want to be able to post comments to a movie page as well as edit my own comments."

---

**Task**

For this ticket, you'll be required to implement two methods in commentsDAO.js, addComment and updateComment.

Ensure that updateComment only allows users to update their own comments, and no one else's comments.

Note:

Remember to wrap the commentId argument with ObjectId(), e.g. ObjectId(commentId). This is the expected format of the _id field.

**MFlix Functionality**

Once this ticket is completed, users will be able to post comments on their favorite (and least favorite) movies, and edit comments they've posted.
