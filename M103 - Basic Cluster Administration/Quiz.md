## Configuration File

Consider the following:

mongod --dbpath /data/db --logpath /data/logs --replSet M103 --bind_ip '127.0.0.1,192.168.0.100' --keyFile /data/keyfile --fork
```

    ```
    storage
    dbPath="/data/db"
    systemLog
    destination="/data/logs"
    replication
    replSetName="M103"
    net
    bindIp="127.0.0.1,192.168.0.100"
    security
    keyFile="/data/keyfile"
    processManagement
    fork=true
    ```
- 
    ```
    storage.dbPath: /data/db
    systemLog.destination: "/data/logs"
    replication.replSetName: "M103"
    net.bindIp: "127.0.0.1,192.168.0.100"
    security.keyFile: "/data/keyfile"
    processManagement.fork: true
    ```
- [X]

    update: "products",
    updates: [
      {
        q: <query>,
        u: <update>,
      }
