- **Durability** - The number of nodes that must write the data to the database for the operation to be considered complete.
- **Data Life** - The amount of time this record will be stored in the database.
- **Data Size** - The number of bytes being written to the database.
- **Storage Size** - The amount of additional storage needed per day to store all new write data for this operation.
- **Average Frequency** - The average number of times this operation occurs per second.
- **Peak Frequency** - The average number of times this operation occurs per second at peak hour frequency.

Which queries are the top 3 most qualitatively important for designing the data model?

- **R1 - user logs into the application**
