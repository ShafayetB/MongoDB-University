# Lab: Apply the Schema Versioning Pattern

Which of the following scenarios are best suited for applying the Schema Versioning Pattern?

**Scenario A:**

Your team was assigned to upgrade the current schema with additional fields without bringing the system down for this upgrade. However, all documents need to be updated to the new shape quickly.

**Scenario B:**

The performance of your application became suboptimal over time. Your team has identified that the most commonly used collection could profit from embedding additional information from other collections using the Subset and Computed Patterns. All documents in the commonly-used collection will need to undergo this modification. If possible, you would like the transition to be done without downtime.

**Scenario C:**

Your company was bought by its slightly more successful competitor. Thankfully both your and your new owner's applications are flexible enough to handle both document shapes well. You do not have to modify the application or your document shape, but due to the merger, you have to keep documents with different structures in the same collection.
