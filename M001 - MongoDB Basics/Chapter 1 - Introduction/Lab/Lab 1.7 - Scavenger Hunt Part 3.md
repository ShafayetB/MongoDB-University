# Lab 1.7: Scavenger Hunt, Part 3

**Problem:**

Based on our shipwrecks dataset, how many shipwrecks lay off the coast of Cancun / Isla Mujeres, Mexico? Choose the answer that best describes the number of shipwrecks you are able to find using Compass.

**Note**

We are currently facing a temporary error in the Compass "Schema" tab. If you encounter a connection error like the one printed below while analyzing the schema for any database in Compass, feel free to skip this lab and proceed further with the course as we are still in the process of fixing this error:

```
An error occurred during schema analysis: connection 4 to cluster0-shard-00-01-jxeqq.mongodb.net:27017 timed out
```

- **0-10**
- 25-50
- 51-100
- 101-200
- 201 or more
