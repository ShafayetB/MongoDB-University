## Array Operators: $elemMatch

**Problem:**

In the M001 class Atlas cluster you will find a database added just for this week of the course. It is called ```results```. Within this database you will find two collections: ```surveys``` and ```scores```. Documents in the ```results.surveys``` collection have the following schema.

```
{_id: ObjectId("5964e8e5f0df64e7bc2d7373"),
 results: [{product: "abc", score: 10}, {product: "xyz", score: 9}]}

## Challenge Problem: Single Value in an Array of Integers

**Problem:**

In the M001 class Atlas cluster you will find a database added just for this week of the course. It is called results. Within this database you will find two collections: surveys and scores. Documents in the results.scores collection have the following schema.

```
{"_id": ObjectId("5964e8e5f0df64e7bc2d7373"), "results": [75, 88, 89]}
