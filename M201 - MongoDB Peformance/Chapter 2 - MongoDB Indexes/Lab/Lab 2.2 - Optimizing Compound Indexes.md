# Lab 2.2: Optimizing Compound Indexes

**Problem:**

In this lab you're going to examine several example queries and determine which compound index will best service them.

```
> db.people.find({
    "address.state": "Nebraska",
    "last_name": /^G/,
    "job": "Police officer"
  })
```
```
> db.people.find({
    "job": /^P/,
    "first_name": /^C/,
    "address.state": "Indiana"
  }).sort({ "last_name": 1 })
```
```
> db.people.find({
    "address.state": "Connecticut",
    "birthday": {
      "$gte": ISODate("2010-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"),
      "$lt": ISODate("2011-01-01T00:00:00.000Z")
    }
  })
```

If you had to build one index on the people collection, which of the following indexes would best sevice all 3 queries?

- { "address.state": 1, "job": 1, "first_name": 1 }
- { "job": 1, "address.state": 1, "last_name": 1 }
- { "job": 1, "address.state": 1, "first_name": 1 }
- { "job": 1, "address.state": 1 }
- **{ "address.state": 1, "last_name": 1, "job": 1 }**
- { "address.state": 1, "job": 1 }
